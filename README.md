NFDI4Ing and Text+ are two consortia of the National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), each systematically recording the metadata of their publications in their own Zotero bibliographies. Additionally, efforts are underway to compile the publications of all 26 consortia in an - as yet incomplete - "NFDI library". For internal and external reporting, NFDI4Ing and Text+ have written Python scripts to automatically read and process the metadata of their publications.

The scripts, together with the data from NFDI4Ing read out on a key date, are available https://zenodo.org/records/12680673 (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.12680673) and from Text+ at https://zenodo.org/records/12605448 (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.12605448). All scripts are published under the CC BY 4.0 license, and reuse is expressly encouraged!

Background to the NFDI4Ing library: On September 29, 2023, the NFDI4Ing consortium submitted an interim report for the first funding period. The NFDI4Ing library was created in advance for the purpose of automated literature management for the interim report. The first Python script from NFDI4Ing reads a subfolder of the library for demonstration purposes and also exports tags and notes. The second Python script reads all publications of the - so far incomplete - "Library NFDI" and exports tags.

Background to the Text+ library: In June 2024, the National Research Data Infrastructure conducted a comprehensive structural evaluation. As part of this evaluation, all consortia were asked to submit a list of all publications published since their foundation. The script focuses exclusively on the publications and exports tags, without reading notes or attachments.
